# Welcome to the Pull Dating Project

Pull is an open-source and community-driven project to make a better option for online dating, so that it is not controlled by a greedy monopoly. It puts transparency, fairness, and real connection above profits. 

Here on github we keep our source code for your viewing pleasure, but if you want to get a better sense of the project, or are looking to contribute, consider the options below:
