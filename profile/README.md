# Welcome to the Pull Dating Project

Pull is an open-source and community-driven, non-profit project to make a better option for online dating, so that it is not controlled by a greedy monopoly. It puts transparency, fairness, and real connection above profits. 

On Github you can view & contribute to the source code of the project, but we also have discussions that you can participate in:
